## Features

### Smooth scrolling

Since the content is currently contained within a single page, smooth scrolling was added to give the user awareness where  they are within a page. The scrolling is implemented within the JSON loader for the navigation bar, along with adjusted to keep the desktop navbar (top of page; stickied) in mind when scrolling down the page. 

### JSON uploader

The content that displays on the HTML page is stored within a JSON file, this is create a clean and consistent template to manage and adjust content. This includes my name, social media icons, and the projects jotted down in th following pages.

### Wallpaper overlays

There's 2 backgrounds being displayed on the top of index.html; the floral wallpaper right above my name, and the transition to white in the foreground.  

### Mobile and Desktop Navigation Bars

There are 2 navigation bars currently beig used on the website, with each having their own functions within the jsonLoader. This includes the desktop navigation bar that is stickied at the top of the page and the hamburger menu for mobile pages.
