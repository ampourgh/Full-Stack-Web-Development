Question 1:
Q1 uses a partial nested loop, with a efficiency of O((n + 1)(n/2)). Since the words are alphabatized and the letters' ORD are compared to discard uneeded letters for subsequent loops, this reduces the amount of looping. Worst case scenario would be if the t string was 'aaa', where a loops through the entirety of string s,  while the best case scenario would be if the string was 'zzz', as the former would be a full nested loop whereas the latter would be simplified as O(n + 1). In terms of space effiency, depending how many letters there are shared between the strings, it would increase or decrease the amount of work. So for the innermost loop the average would be O(3).
